# Guiding Questions

Do your best to answer guiding questions before the indicated class period. Responses don't need to be turned in, but answering helps you prepare effectively for class.

## 11/7: Databases

Before class on Tuesday, install the `DBI` and `duckdb` packages. Post in the #questions channel on Slack if you run into issues.

As you read the [Databases](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/databases.html) chapter of R4DS, answer the following questions:

- What are the differences between client-server, cloud, and in-process database management systems (DBMSs)?
- Make note of how the following functions are used in a database workflow. What does each function do? What inputs/arguments does each function require? Create a set of notes that shows the sequence of these functions in a database workflow.
    - `DBI::dbConnect()`
    - `DBI::dbReadTable()`
    - `DBI::dbGetQuery()`
    - `tbl()`
    - `collect()`
- Make note of how the `showQuery()` function can help you learn SQL (structured query language) by translating `dplyr` code into SQL.
    - As you read Section 22.5 (SQL), create notes that relate parts of SQL queries to `dplyr` functions.


## 10/19: Web scraping

As you read the `rvest` package [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/vignettes/rvest.html), answer the following questions:

- The first step of getting (scraping) data from an arbitrary web page is to read in the webpage. What `rvest` function(s) are relevant for this step?
- Next we need to select the HTML elements that contain the information that we want. What function(s) are relevant here?
    - How would we select all elements that have the class "author"?
    - How would we select all level 1 headers (tag `<h1>`)?
- Next we extract information from the selected HTML elements.
    - What is the difference between selecting the text contents of an HTML element and selecting an attribute of the HTML element? What functions are used for these two tasks?
    - How would we get all URLs for links that appear on a webpage?

## 9/19: Interactive visualization

After listening to [this podcast](https://datastori.es/127-storytelling-with-data-with-cole-nussbaumer-knaflic/) from Chapter 7 (timestamp 18:09) through Chapter 8 (ending at timestamp 25:27), reflect on the following question:

- What was new, unexpected, or interesting in the discussion about animations, interactivity, and dashboards?

<!-- Consider this post for another week: https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2014/04/exploratory-vs-explanatory-analysis -->

## 9/12: Advanced map visualization

After/while watching [this video](https://youtu.be/xJyJlKbZFlc?si=pc7ThQPO-v8ur-qx) on Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS), answer the following questions:

- What is the shape of the Earth?
- Why is GDA94 a great datum name?
- What are the two components of a CRS/GCS?
- Why do we use many different local CRSs rather than just one CRS for the whole earth?
- Why is it insufficient to identify a location by its latitude and longitude?
- Why do we need to be mindful about CRSs when working with different spatial datasets?


## 9/7: Advanced visualization in ggplot

To review plot creation skills from STAT/COMP 112 and STAT 155, use the `diamonds` dataset in the `ggplot2` package to recreate the following visualizations:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=12}
library(gridExtra)
p1 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) + geom_bar() + theme_classic()
p2 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) + geom_histogram() + theme_classic()
p3 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) + geom_density() + theme_classic()
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, nrow = 1)

p4 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = price)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_classic()
p5 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, color = cut)) + geom_density() + theme_classic()
grid.arrange(p4, p5, nrow = 1)

p6 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = color)) + geom_bar() + theme_classic()
p7 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = color)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge") + theme_classic()
p8 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = color)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") + theme_classic()
grid.arrange(p6, p7, p8, nrow = 1)

p9 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point() + theme_classic()
p10 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm") + theme_classic()
grid.arrange(p9, p10, nrow = 1)
```
