# Guiding Questions

Do your best to answer guiding questions before the indicated class period. Responses don't need to be turned in, but answering helps you prepare effectively for class.

## 9/7: Advanced visualization in ggplot

To review plot creation skills from STAT/COMP 112 and STAT 155, use the `diamonds` dataset in the `ggplot2` package to recreate the following visualizations:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=12}
library(gridExtra)
p1 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) + geom_bar() + theme_classic()
p2 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) + geom_histogram() + theme_classic()
p3 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) + geom_density() + theme_classic()
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, nrow = 1)

p4 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = price)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_classic()
p5 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, color = cut)) + geom_density() + theme_classic()
grid.arrange(p4, p5, nrow = 1)

p6 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = color)) + geom_bar() + theme_classic()
p7 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = color)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge") + theme_classic()
p8 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = color)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") + theme_classic()
grid.arrange(p6, p7, p8, nrow = 1)

p9 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point() + theme_classic()
p10 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm") + theme_classic()
grid.arrange(p9, p10, nrow = 1)
```

## 9/12: Advanced map visualization

After/while watching [this video](https://youtu.be/xJyJlKbZFlc?si=pc7ThQPO-v8ur-qx) on Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS), answer the following questions:

- What is the shape of the Earth?
- Why is GDA94 a great datum name?
- What are the two components of a CRS/GCS?
- Why do we use many different local CRSs rather than just one CRS for the whole earth?
- Why is it insufficient to identify a location by its latitude and longitude?
- Why do we need to be mindful about CRSs when working with different spatial datasets?

## 9/19: Interactive visualization

After listening to [this podcast](https://datastori.es/127-storytelling-with-data-with-cole-nussbaumer-knaflic/) from Chapter 7 (timestamp 18:09) through Chapter 8 (ending at timestamp 25:27), reflect on the following question:

- What was new, unexpected, or interesting in the discussion about animations, interactivity, and dashboards?
