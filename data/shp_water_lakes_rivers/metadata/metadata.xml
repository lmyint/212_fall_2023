The geography was initially created from the open water features depicted in the 2005 Generalized Land Use dataset developed by the Metropolitan Council. It is being updated over time with data from a variety of sources. It includes lakes larger than 3 acres and rivers wider than 200 feet. It may also include some smaller open water features as needed by the Metropolitan Council, including all lakes in the Council's lake monitoirng program. This layer does not depict the satutory Ordinary High Water Level of lakes. 

NOTES: 
- This dataset is derived from the Master Open Water Features dataset published by the Met Council.
- The extent of water features varies seasonally and annually with rainfall. The extent of water shown in this dataset may not reflect the current status of a particular water feature.
- When adding new polygons or modifying existing polygons, we will create boundaries based on recent imagery that we think depicts average water levels. We will NOT try to adjust the boundaries for seasonal variations in water levels.   
- Wastewater stabilization ponds, which can be quite large, are not shown in this layer. </abstract><purpose>A general depiction of lakes and rivers in the metro area that is periodically updated.</purpose><supplinf>Generally the Twin Cities 7 County Metropolitan Area.

The scale at which lines were digitized varied as staff zoomed in and out while heads-up digitizing within ArcView, however most lines were digitized at an on-screen scale of no higher than 1:3000. In highly urbanized areas, 1:1500 was more common. 

Subsequent updates have come from a variety of sources, including the East-Central MN one foot orthophotos flown in April 2010, and the 1-meter FSA NAIP imagery flown in summer of 2010.

As a general rule when developing this dataset it was the Metropolitan Council's intention to meet or exceed the National Mapping Accuracy Standards at 1:24,000 (within approximately 40 feet of actual location). No testing has been conducted to verify this.</horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><procstep><procdesc>These water features were extracted from the Metropolitan Council's Generalized Land Use 2005 for the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area dataset.

Land use data development procedures called for digitizing lakes larger than 3 acres and rivers wider than 200 feet. The dataset may also include some smaller open water features.

The value of this field is the Minnesota DNR DOWLKNUM ID if one has been assigned by the DNR. Where no DOWLKNUM has been assigned, a unique sequential number assigned by the Met Council is used, all starting with "99...". For the rivers in the dataset, the GNIS ID for the river is used. 

SYSTEM: Differentiates lacustrine open water features (Lakes) from riverine open water features (Rivers). 

NAME_DNR: The DNR registered name of the lake, if one exists. 

ALT_NAME: The alternative name of the lake.  The source of this is usually the DNR’s Protected Waters dataset or the Metropolitan Council's Lake Annotation Classes.

AREA_ACRES: The area of the polygon feature in acres.</eaover></overview></eainfo><distinfo><resdesc>LakesAndRivers</resdesc><distliab>NOTICE:  The Geographic Information System (GIS) Data to which this notice is attached are made available pursuant to the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act (Minnesota Statutes Chapter 13).
