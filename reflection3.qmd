# Purpose

The goal of this reflection is to look back on and appreciate your growth this semester as well as to set a trajectory for continued growth beyond the semester. Because I am required to submit a letter grade, you will also propose a letter grade for yourself as the start of a conversation between you and me.


# Task

Make your own copy of [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8bzB4fcpWaMJJxxWrpS42VQ56X0P837pCL_73z-4dM/edit?usp=sharing), and follow the reflection prompts in that document. Share your document with me so that I have Editor or Commenter privileges by sometime on **Wednesday, December 13**.
