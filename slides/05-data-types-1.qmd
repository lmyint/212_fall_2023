Open up your Process and Reflection Log (Google Doc).


## Classroom Community and Connectedness debrief

Section 1

- While working in groups on activities was seen as a strength, it was also something that has challenges
    - Meeting and getting to know new people is hard--especially in a classroom environment
- Things that I can do
    - Change groups regularly
    - Create spaces for more *authentic* and *collaborative* group work
    - Out-of class opportunities for hanging out (with food!?)
- Things that you can do
    -  A number of you mentioned that you yourselves wanted to better at fostering community

Note: reflection regarding group work is one of my top learning goals not because I want to judge/evaluate you on it but because I value it. Across your 3 substantive reflections, I just want to give feedback. I won't give mandates that you have to follow "or else".

    - Create spaces for more *authentic* and *collaborative* group work
    - Out-of class opportunities for hanging out (with food!?)

## Project team formation activity

Open up [this Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1rohV7ZvesrnSQufZoKAFP1kVfjU8-F96qVauH7N0jBE/edit?usp=sharing).

1. On a sticky note (left menu), write down the general domain of your ideal project (e.g., environmental/climate issues) and your name.
2. Once everyone is done, work together to group the sticky notes into clusters such that an even number is in each group.
3. Within these groups, re-introduce yourselves and share more specific details about your desired project (e.g., specific research ?s and possible data sources).
4. Form teams (pairs) for your project and decide on a contact/communication strategy outside of class.


## About project teams and "pods"

We'll try out sitting in project pairs to better facilitate community and connection. We'll do a little bit of project work each class period.

On feedback days, pairs will sit with other pairs with similar project domains and different domains. Having this variety of feedback will be important for the quality of your project.


## Thursday: project work

Milestone 2 is about finding an initial dataset and each team member creating one "rough draft" visualization to answer one of your research questions.

I highly recommend using the [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) repository to locate an initial dataset if you don't already have one. (The dataset doesn't have to be a perfect match for your questions.)
