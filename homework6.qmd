<!-- NEED TO UPDATE! -->

# Required parts

Due Wednesday, November 8 by midnight [on Moodle]().


Put this work in a new `homework6.qmd` document. Update the header information in your `.qmd` to look like this:

```yaml
title: "Homework 5: Functions"
author: "YOUR NAME"
format: 
  html:
    self-contained: true
```

When you render this `.qmd`, this will create an HTML file in which images are embedded. Submit this HTML file on Moodle.
