General instructions for homework:

- Process section:
    - On getting help
        - Things I Googled or asked on ChatGPT: There is no shame in having items here! But making note of this is important for noticing what you're not "fluent" in yet. (e.g., when learning a new language, it would be helpful to write down words that you frequently have to look up to translate)
        - Things I consulted with peers about
        - Other resources that I consulted
    - What was easy, medium, hard? Why?

Common elements of weekly homework:

- First part will always be to work on the most recent Tidy Tuesday.
