# Purpose

The goal of this reflection is to check in on your learning as related to the learning goals that we have addressed so far. Most importantly, it is a space for **honest conversation between you and me**.


# Task

Make your own copy of [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clhiZFykeyBpfzvk4KiGtUOillMsFX4MTX2TgyhvStI/edit?usp=sharing), and follow the reflection prompts in that document. Share your document with me so that I have Editor or Commenter privileges by sometime on **Tuesday, November 21**.
