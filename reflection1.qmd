# Purpose

The goal of this reflection is to check in on your learning as related to the learning goals that we have addressed so far. Most importantly, it is a space for **honest conversation between you and me**.


<br><br><br>


# Task

Make your own copy of [this Google Doc](https://www.google.com), and follow the reflection prompts in that document. (The content of that Google Doc is repeated below.)

For each of the following learning goals, you will start with a short exercise. The purpose of the exercise is to try out the skills associated with the learning goal in a new context. As you work through the exercise, make note of your process: where are you confident, and where are you unsure?

After each of these exercises, each learning goal will have a reflection prompt. You will use the following sources of feedback and reflection in these reflections:

1. Process notes from working on the exercise
2. Reflections from your Process and Reflection Log (the Google Doc that I ask you to write in each class)
3. Homework feedback from me in your personal Google Sheet (titled "[YOUR NAME]: STAT212 Feedback")

## Advanced data visualization in `ggplot2`

**Learning goal:** Create a variety of visualizations in `ggplot2` that go beyond the plot types that you learned in STAT/COMP 112

**Exercise:** Look at the graph below from the NYT article [A Summer of Strikes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/03/business/economy/strikes-union-sag-uaw.html).

![](images/reflection1_nyt.png){fig-alt="NYT caption: Union membership has fallen sharply over the past four decades. Share of the work force in a union, by industry." fig-align="center"}

1. Draft a codebook of what variables would be needed to create the graph. Example codebook entry:
    - `sector`: private sector or public sector job
2. Write `ggplot2` code to "recreate" as much of this plot as possible. (You don't have the data, but pretend that you had a dataset with exactly the variables in the codebook you created in step 1.)

**Reflection:** Using the 3 sources of feedback and reflection described above, reflect on your progress towards this learning goal. What patterns do you notice in your reflections and feedback? What is one part about this goal that you're doing well? What is one part about this goal that you'd like to improve on? What can you do to continue making progress? What can the instructor do?

## Map visualization

**Learning goal:** Wrangle and visualize spatial data

**Exercise:** Consider the making of maps with spatial datasets of the `sf` class. In what ways does making a plot with `geom_sf` parallel the making of "ordinary" plots in ggplot?

**Reflection:** Using the 3 sources of feedback and reflection described above, reflect on your progress towards this learning goal. What patterns do you notice in your reflections and feedback? What is one part about this goal that you're doing well? What is one part about this goal that you'd like to improve on? What can you do to continue making progress? What can the instructor do?

## Creating interactive apps

**Learning goal:** Create interactive web applications and visualizations that adapt to user input

**Exercise:** TODO

**Reflection:** Using the 3 sources of feedback and reflection described above, reflect on your progress towards this learning goal. What patterns do you notice in your reflections and feedback? What is one part about this goal that you're doing well? What is one part about this goal that you'd like to improve on? What can you do to continue making progress? What can the instructor do?

## Data wrangling

**Learning goal:** Wrangle arbitrarily messy data using functional programming tools in R

**Exercise:** TODO

**Reflection:** Using the 3 sources of feedback and reflection described above, reflect on your progress towards this learning goal. What patterns do you notice in your reflections and feedback? What is one part about this goal that you're doing well? What is one part about this goal that you'd like to improve on? What can you do to continue making progress? What can the instructor do?

## Reflection skills

**Learning goals:**

- Sustain a habit of self-reflection in your learning process so that you are equipped for independent learning
    - (Class-contributed goal) Skills to be more self sufficient and resourceful when learning new code
- Sustain a habit of self-reflection in your collaborative work so that you can form community no matter where you go

**Exercise:** TODO

**Reflection:** Using the 3 sources of feedback and reflection described above, reflect on your progress towards this learning goal. What patterns do you notice in your reflections and feedback? What is one part about this goal that you're doing well? What is one part about this goal that you'd like to improve on? What can you do to continue making progress? What can the instructor do?
