Each individual takes turns in one of two roles:\n\nDriver: The Driver is at the computer typing and speaking their thought process out loud.\nNavigator: The Navigator reviews all code that the Driver writes as it’s typed, guides the overall direction of the code (keeps the instructions in mind), and pulls up references.\n\nWhy are we using pair programming? Pair programming is used effectively in industry to speed up individual employee’s learning of a company’s codebase and reduce time wasted on fixing bugs."

The common ellipsoid models are known as WGS84 and GRS80.

    "text": "Datum\nEach ellipsoid model has different ways to position it self relative to Earth depending on the center or origin. Each potential position and reference frame for representing the position of locations on Earth is called a datum.\nFor example, two different datum for the same ellipsoid model can provide a more accurate fit or approximation of the Earth’s surface depending on the region of interest (South America v. North America). For example, the NAD83 datum is a good fit for the GRS80 ellipsoid in North America, but SIRGAS2000 is a better fit for the GRS80 ellipsoid in South America. The illustration below shows one datum in which the center of the ellipsoid does not coincide with the center of Earth’s mass. With this position of the ellipsoid, we gain a better fit for the southern half of the Earth.\n\n\n\nIllustration of ellipsoid model and Earth’s irregular surface for a datum that better fits southern part (bottom right) of the Earth. Source: www.icsm.gov.au\n\n\nIt is useful to know that the Global Positioning System (GPS) uses the WGS84 ellipsoid model and a datum by the same name, which provides an overall best fit of the Earth.\nIf you have longitude and latitude coordinates for a location, it is important to know what datum and ellipsoid were used to define those positions.\nNote: In practice, the horizontal distance between WGS84 and NAD83 coordinates is about 3-4 feet in the US, which may not be significant for most applications.\n\nExercise\nGo to https://epsg.io/. Search for a location important to you (state, country, etc.). Filter based on Datum (Geodetic) on the right. Click on one geodetic datum options for your region of interest (make sure your location is listed under Area of Use). Repeat for three locations.\nProvide the region of interest (e.g. United States), the full datum name (e.g. North American Datum 1983), the shorthand name (e.g. NAD83, EPSG: 6269), and the ellipsoid (e.g. GRS 1980).\n\nLocation 1:\n\n\nLocation 2:\n\n\nLocation 3:\n\n\n\nExample Solution\n\n\nLocation 1: South Africa, Cape, EPSG:6222, Ellipsoid: Clarke 1880 (Arc)\n\n\nLocation 2: Thailand, Indian 1975, EPSG:6240, Ellipsoid: Everest 1830 (1937 Adjustment)\n\n\nLocation 3: Colombia, Marco Geocentrico Nacional de Referencia, EPSG:6686, Ellipsoid: GRS 1980\n\n\n\n\nExercise\nLet’s now practice specifying coordinates in a CRS.\nFor geographic coordinate reference systems, the coordinates of locations are specified by latitude (degrees north or south of the equator), longitude (degrees west or east of a prime meridian), and sometimes height.\nFind the location of Macalester College (OLRI) in longitude and latitude degrees.\n\nLongitude:\n\n\nLatitude:\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nLongitude: -93.168855\n\n\nLatitude: 44.936611\n\n\nFor projected coordinate reference systems, the coordinates of locations are typically specified by easting (x) and northing (y).

    "section": "Projection",
    "text": "Projection\nLastly, the Earth lives in a 3 dimensional (3D) world and most visualizations are on a 2 dimensional (2D) surface. We must choose a projection method to represent points, regions, and lines on Earth on a 2D map with distance units (typically meter, international foot, US survey foot). In that projection process, a 3D element will lose angle, area, and/or distance when projected onto a 2D surface, no matter which method is chosen.\nFor a good overview of common projection methods, see https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/70047422/report.pdf.\nOne of the most commonly used projection is the Mercator projection which is a cylindrical map projection from the 1500’s. It became popular for navigation because it represented north as up and south as down everywhere and preserves local directions and shape. However, it inflates the size of regions far from the equator. Thus, Greenland, Antarctica, Canada, and Russia appear large relative to their actual land mass as compared to Central Africa. See the illustration below to compare the area/shape of the countries with the Mercator projection of the world (light blue) with the true areas/shapes (dark blue).\n\n\n\nSource: @neilrkaye\n\n\nBelow you can see four different world projections.

A text file (such as .csv) can store the coordinates in two columns (x,y) in addition to a group id (needed for lines and polygons) plus attributes or properties in additional columns. Note that text files do not store the CRS. However, shapefiles (.shp) developed by ESRI is one of the most widely supported spatial vector file format (that includes the CRS). Additionally, GeoJSON (.geojson) and KML (.kml) are additional popular formats.\n\n\nExercise\nTo create maps, we’ll need to have access to some spatial data.\nGo to the following websites and download the vector data files indicated.

These values could be continuous such as elevation or precipitation or categorical such as land cover or soil type.\nTypically regular cells are square in shape but they can be rotated and sheared. Rectilinear and curvilinear shapes are also possible, depending on the spatial region of interest and CRS.\nBe aware that high resolution raster data involves a large number of small cells. This can slow down the computations and visualizations.\nMany raster file formats exist. One of the most popular is GeoTIFF (.tif or .tiff). More complex raster formats include NetCDF (.nc) and HDF (.hdf). To work with raster data in R, you’ll use the raster, terra, and the stars packages. If you are interested in learning more, check out https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop to Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t yet, check in with your community around you. How could you support their learning?\nShare with them an spatial data idea or topic that is confusing/challenging to you and ask them what topic they find most interesting/cool/connects with other courses?"

Complete these two ways\n\nhex_spatial directly to hex_spatial_sf AND\nhex_spatial_df to hex_spatial_sf.\n\n\n# Convert to SF from hex_spatial_df  \nhex_spatial_sf &lt;- hex_spatial_df %&gt;% ???  \n  \n# Convert to SF from hex_spatial\nhex_spatial_sf &lt;- hex_spatial %&gt;% ???\n\nError: &lt;text&gt;:6:0: unexpected end of input\n4: # Convert to SF from hex_spatial\n5: hex_spatial_sf &lt;- hex_spatial %&gt;% ???\n  ^\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n#Convert to SF from hex_spatial_df  \nhex_spatial_sf &lt;- hex_spatial_df %&gt;% st_as_sf(coords = c(\"long\", \"lat\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(geometry = st_combine(geometry)) %&gt;%\n  st_cast(\"POLYGON\") \n  \n#Convert to SF from hex_spatial\nhex_spatial_sf &lt;- hex_spatial %&gt;% st_as_sf()"

Instead of using the actual geo-political boundaries, we will use hexagons to represent the U.S. states and maintain their relative directional position to each together. This approach results in each state having the same area in the graphic so that large regions don’t dominate the visual story.\n\nExercise\nDescribe what the following code chunks are doing.

This will lead into the “Finding existing functions” part of the activity.\n\n\nSetup\npurrr resources\n\nhttps://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/index.html\nhttps://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-19_purrr\n\n\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(repurrrsive)\n\n\ndata(got_chars)\ngot &lt;- got_chars\n\n\n\nActivity ideas\nWriting functions from scratch: Function Challenge Relay: Divide the students into groups and set up stations with different R function challenges. Each station has a specific task that requires creating or using R functions. The groups rotate through the stations, completing the challenges together. For example, one station might require writing a function to calculate factorial, another to find the mean of a dataset, and so on.\nWrite a function that fits a linear model within subgroups of the data.\nFinding existing functions: Function Library Creation: Assign each group a specific topic or problem domain (e.g., mathematical functions, data manipulation, data visualization). Each group works together to research, design, and implement a set of R functions that address various aspects of their assigned topic. They can then share their function library with the class. Function Scavenger Hunt: Create a scavenger hunt where each group receives a list of R functions to find and examples of tasks to perform using those functions. The hunt can involve finding functions in R documentation, tutorials, or online resources. The group that completes the most tasks correctly wins.\nGroups can put together a nice resource for others (e.g., a cheat sheet). Something more user-friendly than a Google Doc.\nEditing functions writen by others: Function Debugging Party: Give each group a set of R functions with intentional errors or bugs. The groups work together to debug and correct the functions. This activity reinforces the importance of testing and troubleshooting code collaboratively. Function Code Review Workshop: Each group writes an R function and shares it with another group. The receiving group reviews the code, provides feedback, and suggests improvements. This exercise promotes collaborative code development and helps students learn from each other’s code.\n\n\nHomework\nHave students go from gap_nested -&gt; gap_simple and gap_split -&gt; gap_simple\nExtra: other combinations: ehh I don’t know if this is that useful\n\n\npurrr"

    "text": "A note from your instructor\n\n\n\nWhen I started college, the main thinking I did about my capital-F Future (that nebulous thing way out in the distance) was about what I would be doing after college. It made me very anxious.\nThrough the many years since my college experience, I have come to see that what allows me to be more at peace with my capital-F Future now is a deeper understanding of who I am and what my values are.\nI want to give you a chance to do this kind of thinking now with this “assignment”.\n\n\nI invite you to write an essay (tentatively) titled “My past, present and future and the values they express”. (Change the title if you wish!)\nThis essay does not need to be submitted and is not due at any point. If you ever wish to talk to me about what you wrote, the process of writing it, or what you’ve thought about after writing it, I’d love to do that over a walk or a cup of hot chocolate.\nI do hope that by writing it you are able to move forward with your college experience this semester with more peace and clarity. For that reason alone, I suggest that you write this essay by the end of the first week of class (Sunday, September 10).\nIt might be helpful to do/think about the following as you write:\n\nVisit this Values Exercise page to read a very short bit about core values and their role in a fulfilling life. Click the “Start the Exercise” button to complete a ~15 minute exercise to identify your core values.\nWhat events brought you to Macalester, and what core values do you think led you to choose Mac?\nWhere do you see yourself in 10 years? How do you see yourself living? What would it take to get to that point? To think through that process in steps, think about:\n\n10-year vision (what’s going on in 2033 and why?)\n5-year vision (what’s going on in 2028 and why?)\n2-year vision (what’s going on in 2025 and why?)\n1-year vision (what’s going on in 2024 and why?)\n6-month vision (what’s going on in Spring 2024 and why?)\nThinking about the “why” for these visions can help affirm and clarify the core values you ended up with from the Values Exercise above. For example, if part of your 5-year vision wasn’t happening, how would you feel and why?\n\n\nIf it helps at all to look at someone else’s vision as you craft your own, I tried to write my own 10-year vision earlier this summer."

That is, my standards for high quality work are the same between the two.\nWhat’s different is how (who) participates in the evaluation process. In Option 1, I am making the final judgment on the quality of your work for all course components. In Option 2, you will start the assessment of quality by evaluating yourselves using qualitative feedback on all of your work.\nIn Option 2, the qualitative comments that you receive on all your work (reflections, homework, project) will form the basis of your self-evaluation. That is, you will review all comments from me and use this to gauge the degree to which you are meeting the course learning goals. (On homework, you will not receive a pass/not passing designation—you’ll just receive comments.) You will write self-evaluations ~1 month into the semester, in the middle of the semester (before midterm grades are due), and a final one at the end of the semester. In all of these self-evaluations, you will propose the grade that you think deserve. I will also evaluate your work, and if we disagree on the grade, we will meet to discuss what needs to be done next to come to an agreement. (This may involve being doing extra work or revisions.)\nNote: Your self-evaluations need to be based on demonstrated evidence in the work that you submit. For example, if you have struggled with the data wrangling homework assignments and say in your self-evaluation that your understanding is now strong after reviewing feedback, this is not sufficient evidence. You would need to demonstrate your stronger understanding of data wrangling by submitting a revision of the data wrangling homework. (See policy on late work.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse component\nLetter grade: A\nLetter grade: B\nLetter grade: C\n\n\n\n\nSelf-reflection in learning process\nShow clear growth and consistent thoughtfulness throughout the semester\nShow some growth and some thoughtfulness throughout the semester\nShow little to no growth and minimal thoughtfulness throughout the semester\n\n\nSelf-reflection in collaborative learning (groupwork)\n\n\nWeekly homework\nShow strong understanding of concepts across all homework assignments\nShow strong understanding of concepts across most homework assignments\nShow adequate understanding of concepts across most homework assignments\n\n\nFinal project\nComplete a project that is high quality in all of the following aspects:\n\nData wrangling, visualization, analysis, and interpretation\nWorkflow and organization\nAddressing peer and instructor feedback\nGiving feedback to peers\nEthical consideration and communication of results\n\nComplete a project that is at least ok quality in the aforementioned aspects and high quality in some aspects\nComplete a project that is ok quality in the aforementioned aspects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing Options 1 and 2\n\n\n\nBoth options satisfy my goal to have high standards for your learning that are achievable through thoughtful revision. No matter what option we use, you’ll have a personal Google Sheet for tracking your progress over time.\nMy other goals for our grading system are for it to motivate you to learn as much as possible and to reduce stress. For these goals, your input during our Day 1 discussion will be very valuable."

Limited extensions will always be granted:\n\nMy ideal extension: Turn in the homework by the following Monday morning at 9am. (A 4 day, 9 hour extension)\n\nWhy is this ideal for me? I want to return feedback on homework to everyone before the following Tuesday’s class because we will be briefly reviewing homework feedback in small groups.\n\nFirm limit on extensions: You must turn in the homework by 2 weeks after the due date (Wednesdays at 9am).\n\nWhy is this my firm limit? I post solutions to the homework at this point.\nWhat if it’s past the 2-week limit and you still want to turn in the homework in some form? If this is the case, you need to create your own equivalent homework. This involves mapping the original homework’s exercises to a new dataset and completing those exercises. Note that I can’t make any guarantees about when I can get you feedback on this late submission. (Only guarantee = by the end of the semester)"

Students are expected to be familiar with the college’s standards on academic integrity.\nI encourage you to work with your classmates to discuss material and ideas for assignments, but in order for you to receive individualized feedback on your own learning, you must submit your own work. This involves writing your own code and putting explanations into your own words. Always cite any sources you use, including AI (see section below)."

    "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) use\nLearning to use AI tools is an emerging skill that we will explore together in this course. I expect you to use AI (ChatGPT, Google Bard)—in fact, some assignments may require it.\nHowever, you should be aware of the limits of AI:\n\nAI is a tool, but one that you need to acknowledge using. Any ideas, language, or code that is produced by AI must be cited, just like any other resource. [sample suggestion: Please include a paragraph at the end of any assignment that uses AI explaining what you used the AI for and what prompts you used to get the results.] Failure to do so is in violation of the academic integrity policy at Macalester College.\nDon’t trust anything AI says. If it gives you a number, fact, or code, assume it is wrong unless you either know the answer or can check in with another source. AI works best for topics you understand.\nIf you provide minimum effort prompts, you will get low quality results. You will need to refine your prompts in order to get good outcomes. This will take work.\nBe thoughtful about when this tool is useful. Don’t use it if it isn’t appropriate for the case or circumstance.\nThe environmental impact of AI should not be ignored. The building and usage of AI tools consumes a lot of energy (see here and here). For this reason, we will be very thoughtful about when we use AI and will discuss other sustainability behaviors that we can incorporate into our lives to offset this usage.\n\nHow to cite usage of AI: Please copy and paste all prompts and output into an Appendix section accompanying each problem of an assignment.\nIf you have any questions about your use of AI tools, please contact me to discuss them."

    "text": "Ideally before class on Tuesday, September 5 and definitely before class on Thursday, September 7, you should follow these instructions to set up the software that we’ll be using throughout the semester. Even if you’ve already downloaded both R and RStudio, you’ll want to re-download to make sure that you have the most current versions.\n\nHighly recommended: Change the default file download location for your internet browser.\n\nGenerally by default, internet browsers automatically save all files to the Downloads folder on your computer. This does not encourage good file organization practices. It is highly recommended that you change this option so that your browser asks you where to save each file before downloading it.\nThis page has information on how to do this for the most common browsers.\n\n\nRequired: (Re)Download R and RStudio\n\nFIRST: Download R here.\n\nIn the top section, tou will see three links “Download R for …”\nChoose the link that corresponds to your computer.\nAs of September 1, 2023, the latest version of R is 4.3.1 (“Beagle Scouts”).\n\nSECOND: Download RStudio here.\n\nClick the button under step 2 to install the version of RStudio recommended for your computer.\nAs of September 1, 2023, the latest version of RStudio is 2023.06.2+561.\n\nTHIRD: Check that when you go to File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory, you see “Quarto Website” as an option.\n\n\nSuggested: Watch this video describing key configuration options for RStudio.\n\nRequired: Install required packages.\n\nAn R package is an extra bit of functionality that will help us in our data analysis efforts in a variety of ways.\nOpen RStudio and click inside the Console pane (by default, the bottom left pane). Copy and paste the following command into the Console. You should see the text below appear to the right of the &gt;, which is called the R prompt. After you paste, hit Enter.\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\"))\n\n\nYou will see a lot of text from status messages appearing in the Console as the packages are being installed. Wait until you see the &gt; again.\nEnter the command library(tidyverse) and hit Enter.\nIf you see an error message, then there was a problem installing the package. Post the full error message in the #questions channel in our Slack workspace and\nQuit RStudio. You’re done setting up!\n\nOptional: For a refresher on RStudio features, watch this video. It also shows you how to customize the layout and color scheme of RStudio."
